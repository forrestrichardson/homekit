# homekit
Learn how to build some HomeKit code so we can monitor / control the devices in the house
//I am a novice programmer in Swift and intend to write some basic code to figure out how to simplify the activity of managing
//my home so that I can help my wife figure out how to do simple things like turn on/off the TVs, 
//monitor the 'playing' status of the appletvs (in case the kids use the override power button on the tvs,
//and maybe even plug into the ring API to see what's going on with the cameras around the house.
//So ideally focused on homekit but could drift into other home apis
